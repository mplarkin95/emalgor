Exploring EM on GMMs



A. Does it matter if you shuffle the training data or can you present
all the A data, then B data, then C data?
	
	The order of the data does not matter as all of the data is iterated upon seperately feeding in chunks at a time would not effect the GMM algorithim unless those chunks were fed in at different iterations.

B. Is this enough data?  More than enough?
	This is enough data so that based on a few variables and the way that the data distributes itself our model reaches close to the intended goals relatively quickly.

C. Does your model converge?  How fast?
	Our model is largely determined based on the threshold value.  This value when put in the right spot allows our model to converge relatively quickly and return a correct answer. However, placing too high of a threshold constraint causes the program to stall and maintain the same amount of threshold points.  The optimal value is between .96-.97 when .97 works the program stops immidiately at the right answer.
